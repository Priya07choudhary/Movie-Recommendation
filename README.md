# Movie-Recommendation
🎬 Movie Recommendation System
This project is a Movie Recommendation System that suggests movies to users based on similarity scores. It allows users to input a custom dataset and uses similarity metrics (like cosine similarity) to recommend movies based on user preferences.

🚀 Features
✅ Input a custom movie dataset
✅ Uses similarity score (cosine similarity) for recommendations
✅ Provides top-30 similar movie recommendations
✅ Simple and efficient algorithm implementation

🧠 How It Works
Load the dataset using Pandas.
Preprocess the data (remove null values, standardize formats).
Create a feature vector using attributes like genre, description, and cast.
Compute similarity score using cosine similarity:
Recommend top-30 most similar movies based on the similarity score.
